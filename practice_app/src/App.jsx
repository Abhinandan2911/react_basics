          <h1>Education</h1>
          <br />
        <p>
            I have completed my Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA) from KLE's J.T. College of Arts, Commerce, and Science in Gadag. 
            Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) through PGCET, focusing on advanced topics in software development. 
            My coursework includes subjects such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Web Development, and Artificial Intelligence. 
            I actively engage in hands-on projects and coding competitions to enhance my practical knowledge. 
            Apart from my formal education, I follow structured learning resources like Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA sheet. 
            I dedicate a few hours every day to problem-solving and implementing efficient algorithms. 
            Continuous learning is my priority, and I aim to gain expertise in full-stack development and cloud technologies. 
            My academic journey has shaped my logical thinking and problem-solving approach. 
            I believe in lifelong learning and adapting to new challenges in the ever-evolving tech industry. 
            With my education and practical experience, I am preparing myself for a successful career in software development.
